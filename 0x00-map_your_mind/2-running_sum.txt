This program calculates the running sum until
it encounters a negative number to stop adding.

First create a function to add the integers until
it encounters a negative value.

function sumOfNumbers(numbers){
	create a variable to hold the summation.
	_sum = 0
	
	loop through the list of numbers adding
	them to the _sum variable until a negative 
	value is encounted. If a negative value is
	encounted, stop the summation and return the
	result.
	
	return _sum
}
