This program calculates the sum of squares of numbers
given the input of numbers.

Example
numbers = "123"
        = 1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3
sum     = 14

First create a list i.e squares that holds squares of numbers
list_squares = []

Second define a function that takes on a string of numbers
calculates their squares and returns the sum of the squares.

function sumOfSquares(values){
	In this function loop through the values argument
	checking for numbers and squaring them and appending
	the result in a list(i.e list_squares)

	return the sum of list_squares
}

Program flow

Get input from the user as a string of numbers

print prompt "input of number"

Take the input to sumOfSquares and print the results
